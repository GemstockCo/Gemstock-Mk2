# Printer STL's

## For consumers:
When you download the this repository, you'll be set up with a Printer STLs folder.
Since this project is not complete yet and constantly updating is there in no way a guarantee that your local files are still up-to-date. That's why from here you can download the files individualy if you see that they're different from what you currently have on your local machine.

If at any point you find that a part is missing something that would benefit all others, please create an issue in this repositories main code page.

## For collaborators:
To add a new `.stl` file to this folder, click on the `upload file` button in the top right. from there drag or open your `.stl` file or files you want updated in the top box then describe your changes in the title and description box below it.

Do make sure that you commit into a new branch with a nice name, a name suitable for what you just committed
