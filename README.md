# Gemstock-Mk2

A delta 3D printer designed by 3 enthousiasts with cost and effectiveness in mind.

## Navigating our Github pages:
For some this is daily matter, running through the fields that is Github. But for others Github is a ruthless jungle that they don't know how to escape. For those we made a little section here to navigate through these pages and some essential links.

#### Navigation:
At the top of the page you see a big green button saying `Clone or download`, once you click on it you'll be presented with a little options menu with in the bottom a `Download zip` button. you can also click on one of the buttons in the top menu, such as `Issues` or `Wiki`, or on the links underneath this section.

if you find that your printer parts are missing something or think they're outdated (which is entirely possible) you can click on the folder `Printer STLs` in the `Code` page to be taken to the printer parts directory, there you'll find another `readme` to explain how it all works around there, likewise you can click the button underneath this section to be taken there right away.

## History of the Gemstock

In a 3D printing lab not so long ago,
there was a man that who had an internship at that same lab.
He wanted to build a printer, but there were not enough parts in stock of any type of printer to fully build one.
Together with another coworker he came up with a way to combine the parts of the Kossel and the Rostock together to make a functional printer. These parts were made on a custom delta printer suitably named Ruby, known as the mother of the Gemstocks.
This was the birth of the first Gemstock, Sapphire Mk1. Soon after this event there was another enthousiast that came to the lab as guest and saw the printer and also wanted to build one.
After some tweaking and upgrades there was soon a Mk1.5 Gemstock named Azurite.

Later the guys decided to team up and design a new printer that had all of the upgrades of the previous models combined and then some, the results are here to be known as the Gemstock Mk2.

## Features

The Gemstock Mk2 has certain distinct features as to why you would choose this printer over others.

- 300x500mm circular build area
- Magnetic joints to eliminate backlash
- Cheap sourcable parts
- Rigid frame build using 2020 aluminum extrusions

## Versioning

The current version of the Gemstock MK2 delta printer is version 2.
Small incremental updates shall be a named version 2.x
Major milestone updates shall receive a complete new version.
