# Gemstock-Mk2

A delta 3D printer designed by 3 enthousiasts with cost and effectiveness.

### History of the Gemstock

In a 3D printing lab not so long ago,
there was a man that who had in internship at that same lab.
He wanted to build a printer, but there were not enough parts on stock of any type of printer to fully build one.
Together with another coworker he came up with a way to combine the parts of the Kossel and the Rostock together to make a functional printer. These parts were made on a custom delta printer suitably named Ruby, known as the mother of the Gemstocks.
This was the birth of the first Gemstock, Sapphire Mk1. Soon after this event there was another enthousiast that came to the lab as guest and saw the printer and also wanted to build one.
After some tweaking and upgrades there was soon a Mk1.5 Gemstock named Azurite.

Later the guys decided to team up and design a new printer that had all of the upgrades of the previous models combined and then some, the results are here to be known as the Gemstock Mk2.

## Features

The Gemstock Mk2 has certain distinct features as to why you would choose this printer over others.

-300x500mm circular build area
-Magnetic joints to eliminate backlash
-Cheap sourcable parts
-Rigid frame build using 2020 aluminum extrusions

## Versioning

The current version of the Gemstock MK2 delta pritner is version 2.
Small incremental updates shall be a named version 2.x
Major milestone updates shall receive a complete new version.
