# Printer STL's

When you download this repository, you'll be set up with a Printer STLs folder.
Since this project is not complete yet and constantly updating is there in no way a guarantee that your local files are still up-to-date. That's why from here you can download the files individualy if you see that they're different from what you currently have on your local machine.

If at any point you find that a part is missing something that would benefit all others, please create a new issue in this repositories issue section.
