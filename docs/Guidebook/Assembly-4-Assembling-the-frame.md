Time to assemble the main frame itself.

Take your 10mm smooth rods and cut these to your desired length, we recommend a length between 800-1000mm for maximum stability and most effective print height.

After cutting take some sandpaper or a file and make the ends of all 6 nice and smooth so they don't have any sharp edges.

Next, insert the rods into the holes of the bottom vertex assembly the press them flush with the underside of the vertices. You might need your rubber mallet for this.

Next take your top vertex assembly and flip it upside down so the closed side faces up.

Then place it on top of the rods and use your rubber mallet to insert the rods flush to the top of the top vertices.

Next measure the distance between the top and bottom of the aluminium extrusions and adjust the smooth rods so that all sides are the same length apart.

Lastly fasten the clamps of the smooth rods using M3xxmm bolts and nuts, fasten these tight but do not over tighten these as it may break the clamps on the vertices.
