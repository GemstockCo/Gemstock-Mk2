The first step is to make sure you have every part available and in working order.

Check your printed parts for any major defects or warping and that you have enough hardware to assemble your Gemstock-Mk2.

Have your favorite beverage at hand for consumption during the assembly, we don't want anyone dehydrating during the assembly. :wink: 

Also make sure you have the right tools available, you will need;
- Screwdrivers of various sizes
- Digital multi-meter
- M5 Tap and die set
- Pliers
- Alan keys (hex-head keys)
- Rubber hammer (or a regular one and a piece of cloth/towel)
- Cyanoacrylate glue (CA Glue)
- Saw (if you still need to cut your effector arms or vertex rods to the right size)
- Scissors

Got all that?
Good!
Then off we go to the first step of the assembly.
